# Ignite - Timer

Project developed during a ReactJS module in Ignite program by Rocketseat. The purpose of this app was to develop a timer for tasks, which also allows users to see them in a history page.

## Take Aways

It was very easy to realize how much you can actually implement to make your React Application very robust and responsive.

I think two of the biggest lessons in this project were the Reducer and Context hooks. I intend to practice them all over again in order to master such useful solutions.

## Possible Improvements

One of the main improvements is that the user should be able to stop the cycle and re-start it from where it stopped. Also, I would add some sort of sound when the cycle is finished.


## Setup

After cloning or downloading the project, use the commands below in the terminal.

```bash
  cd my-project
  npm install my-project
  npm run dev
```
